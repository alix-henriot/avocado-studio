# Project
**Avocado Studio Pro** is an open-source landing page designed to showcase photography services for Chinese companies with photography needs in South France.

## Design Inspiration
The layout first took cues from the Apple Music web page, focusing on simplicity and elegance. It gets in complexity over time in order to show everything the persona needs.

## Purpose
When selecting a photographer, potential clients value image quality and transparent pricing. This landing page addresses these priorities with a streamlined call-to-action for quotes, making it easy for visitors to inquire and connect.

## Libraries and Utilities
- **Animations**: Tailwind CSS for simple CSS animated components & Framer Motion for complex scroll and state driven animations.
- **UI Components**: NextUI
