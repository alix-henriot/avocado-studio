# Project
**Avocado Studio Pro** is an open-source landing page designed to showcase photography services for international companies operating in South France.
The page is tailored to appeal specifically to this audience with a clean and minimalistic design that highlights the quality of the work and builds trust.

## Design Inspiration
The layout takes cues from the Apple Music web page, focusing on simplicity and elegance. The design prioritizes visual storytelling by incorporating large, immersive components to prominently feature images and videos.

## Purpose
When selecting a photographer, potential clients value image quality and transparent pricing. This landing page addresses these priorities with a streamlined call-to-action for quotes, making it easy for visitors to inquire and connect.
